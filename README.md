# robGarch

**robGarch** is an R package aiming to provide a method for modelling robust Garch processes (RG), addressing the issue of robustness toward additive outliers - instead of innovations outliers. This work is based on Muler and Yohai (2008) (MY).

## Installation

The package can be installed as following:

```js
  import { Component } from '@angular/core';
  import { MovieService } from './services/movie.service';

  @Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
    providers: [ MovieService ]
  })
  export class AppComponent {
    title = 'app works!';
  }
```

```js
devtools::install_github("EchoRLiu/robGarch")
library(robGarch)
```
